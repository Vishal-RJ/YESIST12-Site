        <p class="subtitle">
          Ever wondered how a single idea can change the world? The Junior
          Einstein Track is not just a competition; it's a journey that
          ignites the curiosity and imagination of young minds. This track is
          dedicated to empowering the next generation of innovators, nurturing
          their ideas, and fueling their passion for finding solutions to
          various social issues. We endeavor to channel the creative
          submissions and innovative spirit of school students aged 12 to 17
          towards scientific and technological ideas. We aspire to establish
          this event as a leading global project competition, fostering a
          robust scientific temperament among the youth. This track is more
          than a competition; it's a platform for young innovators to make
          their mark on the world through their innovations. Let's turn your
          imagination into innovation!
